  When detecting objects in UAV-captured images, we observe that different frequency bands of an image have distinct effects on the generalization performance of UAV-OD network, with some contributing positively and others negatively. Based on this observation, we propose that, beyond the spatial domain, the frequency domain can also serve as a hidden axis for improving generalization. We introduce the paradigm of frequency domain disentanglement, where learnable filters are employed to decouple domain-invariant spectral components.
