  We observe that, compared to general object detection scenarios such as autonomous driving or video surveillance, where objects are typically larger, the detection of small objects in UAV-captured images reveals more pronounced differences in how different frequency bands affect network generalization. This observation offers a stronger rationale for the specificity and suitability of applying frequency domain disentanglement in small-object detection tasks.

  We validate that beyond the spatial domain, the frequency domain indeed offers a discriminative axis for decoupling invariant features.
