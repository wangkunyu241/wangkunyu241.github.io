  The core insight of this paper is that the pairwise angular structure in pre-trained weights encodes a domain-invariant semantic prior that should be preserved when adapting to target domains. Preserving this structure prevents the model from drifting away from essential semantic capabilities during adaptation. We validate this insight with theoretical justification, statistical analysis, functional validation, visual interpretation, and intuitive explanation.
