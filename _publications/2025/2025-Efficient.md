  The core insight of this paper is that during source-to-target domain transfer, not all source-learned features are beneficial, some can even degrade target performance. Based on this insight, we propose focus adaptation on the helpful parts, and ignore the harmful ones. This selective strategy reduces adaptation difficulty and lowers computational cost, leading to more efficient transfer.
