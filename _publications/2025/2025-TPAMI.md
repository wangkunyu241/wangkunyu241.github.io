  We construct a million-scale UAV-based referring expression comprehension dataset to enable precise localization of human-specified targets in UAV imagery. This capability enables efficient retrieval of user-specified targets from massive UAV-captured scenes, replacing manual visual search. It is especially beneficial for time-sensitive or labor-constrained applications such as search and rescue, urban patrol, and agricultural inspection.
