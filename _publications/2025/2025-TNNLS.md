  The complementary learning system in the human brain enable humans to continually learn and remember various events, extracting statistical patterns from these events to develop the ability to generalize to new situations. Inspired by this, we propose a continual learning framework that mimics the complementary learning system. Our framework allows the network to continually accumulate knowledge and expand its knowledge base, thereby improving its ability to generalize to unseen scenarios.
