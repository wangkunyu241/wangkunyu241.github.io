  Hello, I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://en.sist.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm" target="_blank">School of Information Science and Technology</a>, <a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China </a> (USTC), supervised by <a href="https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/chazhengjun/en/index.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Zheng-Jun Zha</a>. Previously, I received my B.E. from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young" target="_blank">Special Class for the Gifted Young</a>, <a href="https://wjx.seu.edu.cn/wjxen/" target="_blank">Chien-Shiung Wu College</a>, <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/" target="_blank">Southeast University</a> (SEU), majoring in Automation. In addition, I also work as a research intern at the <a href="https://www.baai.ac.cn/en/" target="_blank">Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence</a> (BAAI) & <a href="https://www.galbot.com/" target="_blank">GALBOT</a>, working closely with <a href="https://hughw19.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. He Wang</a>.
  </p> 
  <p>
  My Ph.D. research mainly focuses on <b>Machine Learning</b>, with specific directions including <b>Domain Generalization</b>, <b>Test-time Adaptation</b>, and <b>Continual Learning</b>. During my internship, my research focuses on <b>Embodied AI</b>, with specific directions including <b>Embodied Navigation</b>, <b>Vision-Language-Action Models</b>, and <b>Multimodal Large Models</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  My research interests include enhancing the generalization and robustness of modelsâ€™ perceptual capabilities in open-world environments, and enabling robots to perceive, understand, and act in the real world. In my future research career, I hope to pursue work that either drives influential and insightful advances in technology, or explores fundamental principles with scientific significance underlying challenging problems.
  </p>
  <p>
  <span style="color: red;">I am actively looking for postdoctoral opportunities. If you have a suitable position or collaboration in mind, please feel free to contact me by email.</span>
